# `Language-Recognition with SVM in python` üêç:

This project aims to create a pipeline that extract youtube videos and perform transcription on their related audios. 
The code gets a list of youtube channels and scraps all videos that are tagged with some keywords (defined in keyword file). After downloading audios, comments and available transcriptions. A language detection model detects the language spoken in the video and perform transcription. The supported languages are:  **`Swahili`**, **`Wolof`**, **`French`**, **`English`**, **`Arabic`** and **`Dyula`**.



In order to Run the code. 
- Run the `Getting videos Urls` first to get all videos with specified tags in the Keywords files and channels names in youtube_channels file.
- After that, run the `Youtube-video-transcriptor` notebook to get video transcription.

- Model performance: Here are the results obtained after training the model
